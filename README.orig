vimDebug integrates your favorite debugger with vim.  it currently supports
  gdb (the GNU debugger),
  the perl debugger,
  pdb (the python debugger), and
  jdb (the java debugger)

right now, the code has been tested on linux only and definately isn't going to
work on windows without cygwin.  please let me know if this works or not on
other platforms.

there are still some bugs!  especially in jdb.  this is super beta alpha pre
not yet version 1.0 software.

if you would like to help out send patches to vimDebug at iijo dot org.
especially patches to make this stuff work with windows or other platforms or
to add support for a whole new debugger or anything else!  =)  check out the
TODO file if you are bored.  thanks.
