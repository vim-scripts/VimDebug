VimDebug is designed to integrate your favorite debugger with Vim.  Currently
supported debuggers: Perl, Ruby, Python.  Hopefully more are coming.  This is a
much more mature version than the last release.  But it is still beta.  Tested
on Linux and SunOS.  Doesn't work on Windows (might with cygwin).  

Now includes a console showing debug output straight from the debugger.

Please email me about any problems you may have.
