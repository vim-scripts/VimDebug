VimDebug is designed to integrate your favorite debugger with Vim.  Currently
supported debuggers: Perl, Ruby.  Hopefully more are coming.  This is a much
more mature version than the last release.  But it is still beta.  Tested on
Linux and SunOS.  Doesn't work on Windows (might with cygwin).  

Please email me about any problems you may have.
