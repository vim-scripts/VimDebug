USAGE

if you want to customize these keymappings, edit vimDebug.vim:

<F12>      starts the debugger
<Leader>s/ starts the debugger with command line arguments that you type in
<F10>      restart debugger.  break points are ALWAYS saved (for all dbgrs)
<F11>      exit the debugger

<F6>       next
<F7>       step
<F8>       continue

<Leader>b  set break point on the current line
<Leader>c  clear break point on the current line

<Leader>v  print the value of variable under the cursor
<Leader>v/ print the value of an expression that you type in

<Leader>/  type in a command for the debugger to execute, and echo the result.
           (note that its not hard to make everything crash horribly with this
           command if you do something like change the prompt.)
