TODO
(key: + done, - not done)

+ fix all the bugs
+ test suite
+ all signs get unplaced when you quit the debugger in one buffer.  if you are
  running another debugger session inside another buffer this unplaces those
  signs too.  annoying.
- if buffer was edited, no debugger commands should work until user quits or
  restarts the debugger?
+ keep track of breakpoints in vdd not vimDebug.vim.  this is because vdd gets
  restarted each time and so breakpoints would be forgotten if we kept track of
  them inside vdd.
+ restore break points when user restarts debugger.  clear all break points
  when user quits debugger and then starts again.
+ add a clear all break points feature.  this should be fairly easy.
+ you can only run one session per directory.  which is very not intuitive
  for the user.  this should get fixed.
+ the perl debugger doesn't check the whole file for syntax before beginning
  to debug.  it just jumps right in there.  it would be nice if vimDebug
  showed the compile errors that came up as the user steps through the
  code
- show application stdout from command()?  because lots of perl people will do:
  print Dumper $foo to output the object more nicely.
- perl debugger outputs to STDERR.  application outputs to STDOUT.  how should
  i display application output to the user?  an optional separate window?  a
  popup box?
- when a runtime error or compile time error occurs, jump to the bad line
- add an optional "console mode"?  basically a window displaying cmd results?
- add an optional stack frame window?


greater os support
- windows support
- does vimDebug work on cygwin?  if not, make it happen.
- does vimDebug work on solaris? if not, make it happen. (need a box to test on)
- does vimDebug work on bsd?     if not, make it happen. (need a box to test on)
- etc.


more support for different debuggers
- dbx support (SUN's C debugger)
- should we borrow emacs java debugger code?  jdb is ok, but not great.  sun
  wrote it more as an example of how to use the JDPA (java debugger
  programmer's api), than for people to actually use.  should we implement our
  own java debugger like the emacs folks did with their emacs jde
  (http://jdee.sunsite.dk/)?  Sun's debugger api to make writing our own java
  debugger easy-ish:

- add new debuggers!  a vimscript debugger?  anyone know ruby?  assembly?
