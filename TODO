.:: todo

- fix all the bugs
- add a clear all break points feature.  this should be fairly easy.
- you can only run one session per directory.  which is very not intuitive
  for the user.  this should get fixed.
- the perl debugger doesn't check the whole file for syntax before beginning
  to debug.  it just jumps right in there.  it would be nice if vimDebug
  showed the compile errors that came up as the user steps through the
  code
- add an optional "console mode"?  basically a window displaying cmd results?
- add an optional stack frame window?

greater os support
- windows support
- does vimDebug work on cygwin?  if not, make it happen.
- does vimDebug work on solaris? if not, make it happen. (need a box to test on)
- does vimDebug work on bsd?     if not, make it happen. (need a box to test on)
- etc.

more support for different debuggers
- dbx support (SUN's C debugger)
- should we borrow emacs java debugger code?  jdb is ok, but not great.  sun
  wrote it more as an example of how to use the JDPA (java debugger
  programmer's api), than for people to actually use.  should we implement our
  own java debugger like the emacs folks did with their emacs jde
  (http://jdee.sunsite.dk/)?  Sun's debugger api to make writing our own java
  debugger easy-ish:
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/guide/jpda/architecture.html.
- add new debuggers!  a vimscript debugger?  anyone know ruby?  assembly?
