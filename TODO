TODO
(key: + done, - not done)

- test and fix edge cases: perl not found, ruby not found, compiler error, etc.
- behavior if buffer was edited?
- when a runtime error or compile time error occurs, jump to the bad line
- add an optional stack frame window?
- add watchpoints

greater os support
- windows support
- does vimDebug work on cygwin?  if not, make it happen.
- does vimDebug work on solaris? if not, make it happen. (need a box to test on)
- etc.

more support for different debuggers
- gdb
- should we borrow emacs java debugger code?  jdb is ok, but not great.  sun
  wrote it more as an example of how to use the JDPA (java debugger
  programmer's api), than for people to actually use.  should we implement our
  own java debugger like the emacs folks did with their emacs jde
  (http://jdee.sunsite.dk/)?  Sun's debugger api to make writing our own java
  debugger easy-ish:
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/guide/jpda/architecture.html.
- dbx support (SUN's C debugger)
- etc.

- switch from IPC::Run to IPC::Cmd?
