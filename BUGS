.:: known bugs



- !!! strange bug occasionally happens.  the debugger doesn't always step when
  its told to.  if you restart it (<F10>), then it may step or it may not.
  this is really annoying.  does anyone know what i'm doing wrong?  or even how
  to reliably recreate it?  if you restart vi it goes away.

.:: known bugs in vimDebug.vim (vim script stuff)
- sometimes, when debugging, the you will step over a function, for example,
  and in that function, your code will get stuck in an infinite loop.  this is
  frustrating because vi gets hung in limbo forever and you can't control-c out
  of it.  (any suggestions?  perhaps gvim --remote-send should be used instead
  of pipes).

.:: known bugs in Jdb (java debugger)
- things get foobared if you are debugging nested classes or if you are
  debugging a class that doesn't have its own file.

.:: known bugs in Pdb (python debugger)
- if the user changed their python prompt, vimDebug is going break on
  restart().
