KNOWN BUGS

- all the break point stuff should be handled by VimDebug::Debugger functions.
  currently there is an array to keep track of that stuff in vimscript.  and
  there is an array to keep track of that stuff in some of the debugger
  modules.

- perl debugger prints ornaments to the screen and the console looks like crap
  in vim.  console looks fine on gvim.  the opposite is true when you turn off
  the console.

- console needs a lot of work.  i really need to add a new pipe to show what the
  debugger is saying.
