VimDebug is designed to integrate your favorite debugger with Vim.  Currently supported debuggers are Perl, Ruby, and Python.  There is untested support for gdb as well in this release.  There are plans to support more languages.  This is a much more mature version than previous releases, but it is still beta.  

This release includes a solid debug console.

Please email me about any problems you may have.


Requirements

unix/linux
perl
IPC::Run perl module (http://search.cpan.org/~rsod/IPC-Run-0.80/lib/IPC/Run.pm)
vim with +signs compiled in.


Usage


Set/reset these in your .vimrc if you want:

<F12>      starts the debugger
<Leader>s/ starts the debugger with command line arguments that you type in
<F10>      restart debugger.  break points are always saved (for all dbgrs)
<F11>      exit the debugger

<F2>       show console
<F6>       next
<F7>       step
<F8>       continue

<Leader>b  set break point on the current line
<Leader>c  clear break point on the current line

<Leader>v  print the value of variable under the cursor
<Leader>v/ print the value of an expression that you type in

<Leader>/  type in a command for the debugger to execute, and echo the result.
           (note that its not hard to make everything crash horribly with this
           command if you do something like change the debugger prompt.)


let g:DBGRconsoleHeight   = 7
