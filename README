VimDebug gives developers the ability to visually step through their code and set breakpoints.  Currently supported debuggers are Perl, Ruby, and Python.  

This plugin is still in beta.  Bug reports are needed.  Code is available on github: https://github.com/kablamo/VimDebug


Requirements

Ubuntu/OSX/Unix
Perl
A small number of Perl modules
Vim with +signs compiled in.


Usage

Set/reset these in your .vimrc if you want:

<F12>      Start the debugger
<Leader>s/ Start the debugger with command line arguments
<F10>      Restart debugger.  Break points are saved.
<F11>      Exit the debugger

<F2>       Show console
<F6>       Next
<F7>       Step
<F8>       Continue

<Leader>b  Set break point on the current line
<Leader>c  Clear break point on the current line

<Leader>v  Show the value of variable under the cursor
<Leader>v/ Show the value of any expression

<Leader>/  Enter a command for the debugger to execute, and echo the result.
